# 🏥💬 Developing a Next-Gen Chatbot in Jaclang
> **Assignment - AI Lecture Series**

In this multipart assignment series, we will develop a chatbot capable of generating both **domain-specific** and **user-specific** responses.

## ⚠️ Problem Definition

The current market's chatbots, which largely rely on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, often hallucinate and misinterpret information. These inaccuracies arise due to limited context awareness and lack of up-to-date information on specific topics. This poses a significant challenge for chatbots designed to provide **domain-specific** answers.

## 🎯 Final Goal

The aim is to build a chatbot in **Jaclang** that accurately answers user queries using specific data. The project will focus exclusively on **health and medical questions**. 

### 🚀 Chatbot Objectives:

- A chatbot that uses three different techniques for answering health-related queries:
  1. **📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a repository of expert articles on health and medicine.
  2. **👤 Personalized Responses** based on user data to offer tailored health advice.
  3. **📅 Medical To-do Recommendations** based on the patient’s medical tasks, such as prescriptions or appointments.

- **Query Routing:** The user's query will be automatically routed to the appropriate response technique, depending on the context.
